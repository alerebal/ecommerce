# Ecommerce

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3 and updated to Angular version 9.1.13

In this project I started to learn about Stripe and applied it in
              a simple way. It does not work as I would like, I am trying to fix
              some things. I am going to learn about Redux as my next goal and
              apply it here as well. Another next step in this project will be
              to make it responsive for small screens. It does right now, but
              not how I like it. I used Node and Express on the backend, using
              bcryptjs, json web token, cors and several more modules,
              Cloudinary as the file server, MongoDb as the database, and
              Angular on the frontend and Bootstrap.
              
I deployed it in Vercel
